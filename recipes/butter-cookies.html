    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">
        This simple butter cookies recipe can be used in a cookie press, 
        made as a drop cookie, or shaped into a roll and sliced. 
        There is no special cookie recipe for a cookie press — 
        any stiff butter type of cookie can be used! Just be sure to chill it 
        thoroughly so it keeps its shape while baking.\
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light 
            and fluffy. Beat in egg, then stir in the vanilla. Combine flour and salt in a 
            separate bowl; add to butter mixture and mix to form a dough. 
            Cover dough with plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Chill two cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Transfer chilled dough to a cookie press; press out onto chilled cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden at the edges, about 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.</li>
    </ol>
